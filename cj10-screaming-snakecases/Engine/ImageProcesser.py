# This file should contain image processing functions, as ImageTools contain image manipulation functions
# Potential things to add (@Envsxion)

# Forgery detection: Implement algorithms to detect image tampering or forgery.
# Steganography tools: Kinda self explanatory.
# Hashing and authentication: Implement image hashing and authentication mechanisms.
# Noise Analysis
# Blur Detection
# Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR): dunno how but ig we can just use an api or send it off to google images
# OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
# Geolocation analysis 
# Image Comparison (finding mathematical differences between images to reveal the flag??)
# File Format Analysis (images inside an image are a great way to f ppl over) 


# Seems like quite a bit though, maybe we could come up with a more concrete direction for our game, and narrow down the scope?
# Brings in opportunities to differntiate the final product also; seems like many would come up with the same idea
